Make your own step-by-step guide
================================

This template allows you to build a more advanced step-by-step guide.
The example theme here is for you to change as much as you like to
create appearance and content which are truly your own.

READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of
this for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but
instead are just text comments about the code. For this project, the
comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing
the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding
of what you are being asked to do.

GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like
this <p> </p>. The tags tell you something about the information
contained between them. Click on the tags in the code on this side
of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for.

IN THIS CHALLENGE, YOU WILL LEARN ABOUT:

- HTML: Nested lists
- HTML: Unordered list
- HTML: Captions
- CSS: Borders
- CSS: Embedding images and videos

Do you know what happens when thousands of people all leave one place at the same time? <strong> CHAOS. </strong> Park far away in close neighborhoods, so when the mass exodus commences, all you have to do is go for a little walk then you're long gone! Plus, the walk will help burn off the extra calories you amassed slamming beers at the game (responsibly, of course). Knock out two birds with one stone!</p>

              <h3><strong>Complete Your Pre-game Rituals.</strong></h3>
              <p>Anytime before the game begins, you must complete your pre-game rituals. This step can be first or tenth, as long as it happens before the game commences. I slot my pre-game ritual right here because mine typically happens during my long walk to the game. My ritual includes slamming three or four beers with friends and housing some food, preferably Port of Subs. The expedited intake is strategic, we don't want to spend too much money at the game, so it's wise to get your mind right before entering the venue.</p>

              <p>Now, this step may not be for everybody. If you're uncomfortable sneaking a few items into the venue, I grant you my benevolent permission to skip this step without judgment. Please don't let me corrupt your sensibilities. Due to the previously mentioned goal of saving money, I recommend you sneak in a few cheap dollar liquor shots from the corner store (if you're of age, of course) and a few pieces of candy. I like sour skittles. This step is recommended because stadium fare is <i>expenisve</i> and we're cheapskates, right? We try and save money at every turn. <strong>WARNING:</strong> women's purses are checked, so don't pack that contraband in your bag.

              <p>Alright, young padawan. You're finally in the venue with your pre-game rituals completed and contraband in hand. Now what? Find your seat. If you're having trouble, there is a gaggle of stadium personnel prepared to help guide you. That's what they're here for! Next, you have to settle in. The process of "settling in" includes that $20 bill I said you'd need initially. You can't sneak in everything! Use your $20 however you see fit. I like to buy two 8$ beers and more candy. My friend's girlfriend <i>always</i> gets a caramel apple coated in nuts. Find your caramel apple. After you're settled, you can actually do what you came here to do, WATCH THE GAME! You don't have to study it, but please don't bury your head in your phone for most of the game. </p>

              <h3><strong>In-game Hacks</strong></h3>
              <p>Now that the game is playing, there isn't much else to do besides sit back, relax, and watch the Wolf Pack kick some butt, preferably UNLV. But, there are a couple of tips that can increase your and your party's experience attending a major Nevada Wolf Pack sporting event:
                  
                  <div>1. Plan for long lines at the bathroom if you go at halftime. I recommend going to the bathroom a few minutes before or after halftime because, during halftime, there is a log jam. </div>
                  
                  <div>2. Save your ticket. Every ticket has a kick-ass food deal connected to a local eatery. So don't lose it.</div>
                  
                  <div>3. If you brought some kiddos, seek out Nevada's mascots. We have three, and they love to liven up the atmosphere and take pictures with kids. Take advantage! Plus, it's an easy way to punt the brats away for ten minutes. I doubt they'll get kidnapped! </div> </p>

              <h3><strong>Watch the Game Until the Very End and Laugh at Parking Garage Suckers</strong></h3>
              <p>Use common sense here. I'm not asking you to torture yourself and watch the Pack team get blown out. I'm asking you to stay until the game is <i>over</i>. Too often, fair-weather fans leave a close game to "BeAt thE TRafFic." <strong>UNPREPARED LOSERS!</strong> Remember, we're diligent, we planned for this. The whole venue could leave at once, and your exodus will be a breeze. You know why? Because you parked farrrr awayyyyy and not in the parking garage. </p>

              <h3>Use Your Ticket Deal on the Way Home</h3>
              <p>The games over, you have a designated driver, and you're hungry. No worries, use the ticket stub you save to hit up your local haunt and grab a bite. When fans last attended games, Two seasons ago, a game stub would get you a free order of chili cheese fries from Del Taco if the Men's Basketball team made a three or the Football team scored more than 21 points. And we're talking about the Wolf Pack, so that's a guarantee. As you inhale your dish, feel pride. You just attended a Nevada sporting event in the most efficient way possible. You're now officially a Wolf Pack fan. Chris Ault would be proud.  </p>
